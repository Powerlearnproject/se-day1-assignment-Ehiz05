Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering: is the integration of hardware and software components to create applications using low-level and high-level 
computer languages.
Importance in technology industry - It helps business operations to seamlessly achieve goals and objectives
                                    Application versioning for upward improvement
                                    Helps to expeditiously achieve task or goals.
                                    

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Micro Computers & Workstations: for micro computers compilers were developed to aid programming while work stations brought about demand for software due to its ability to compile complex programmes.

Object-Oriented Programming introduced polymorphic concepts.
Artificial Intelligence uses neural systems, natural languages etc. 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirement gathering and analysis - Extracting user data for model development
Design - software architecture is generated for onward process.
Implementation or coding - source code is created.
Testing - source code is push to github/central repository for evalution.
Deployment - after testing application is deployed
Maintenance - commences to ensure reusability, error free and scalability


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

i. Waterfall approach uses sequential and linear method while agile implement iterative and incremental.
ii.Waterfall testing is done upon completion of the development phase while agile integrates throughout the development cycles


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
i.   Quality Assurance
ii.  Efficiency
iii. Diverse expertise

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Refactoring - Seamless code structure improvement.
Error debugging - IDEs are useful with inline highlighting and suggestions.
Customization - With extensions and plugins IDE can be designed to match your style and project needs. 
Efficiency - They enhance coding experience through code suggestions, automated tasks and saving precious time. 


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Software compatibility issues - When code quality are non scalable, it impedes version upgrade.
Strategy: Ensuring codes are developed following standard for reusability.

Project Management and Timelines -  Effectively utilizing project timeline to meet deadlines while maintaining quality is challenging.
Strategy: Setting workable project timelines in order to avert time shortages.

Ethical Considerations - Ethical issues such as bias in algorithms and the responsible use of AI are becoming increasingly important.
Strategy: Developers must ensure that their software is fair, and transparent, and does not inadvertently perpetuate biases or cause harm.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit - Used in testing individual units of software application using automation by developers and by default, ensures it works as intended. It is designed to test specific parts of the code, such as a particular function or method. 
Importance: It helps to ensure that changes to the code do not introduce new bugs.
            It makes the code more modular and easier to understand and maintain.
            It helps to identify bugs early in the development process before they become more difficult and expensive to fix.

Integration - It is a method of testing how different units or components of a software application interact with each other. It is used to identify and resolve any issues that may arise when different units of the software are combined. 
Importance - It helps to ensure that the different units of the software work together as intended.
It helps to improve the overall reliability and stability of the software.
Itâ€™s important to keep in mind that Integration testing is essential for complex systems where different components are integrated.

System - Evaluates function and performance of a complete and fully integrated software solution. It tests if the system meets the specified requirements and if it is suitable for delivery to the end-users. This type of testing is performed after the integration testing and before the acceptance testing.
Importance - The testers do not require more knowledge of programming to carry out this testing.
It checks the entire functionality of the system with different test scripts and also it covers the technical and business requirements of clients.
After this testing, the product will almost cover all the possible bugs or errors and hence the development team will confidently go ahead with acceptance testing.

Acceptance - It is done by the customers to check whether the delivered products perform the desired tasks or not, as stated in the requirements. We use Object-Oriented Testing for discussing test plans and for executing the projects.
Importance - It is easier for the user to describe their requirement.
             Automated test execution.
             It brings confidence and satisfaction to the clients as they are directly involved in the testing process.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering assist in generative AI models comprehension and response to queries, from the simple to the highly technical.
Importance: Structured prompts can enhance the accuracy and relevance of the AI's responses


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

"Tell me about evolution" - Evolution is a broad topic hence the result will be general and not particularly decriptive or relative to what is expected.
Improved prompt: "Tell me about the evolution of modern african culture" - This prompt is more detailed and descriptive and will generate desired response.
